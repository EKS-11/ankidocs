= Changes in 2.0.4 =

2.0.4 is undergoing final beta testing and is expected to be sent to Apple
within a few days.

* Syncing improvements:
** Check that the collection is consistent before syncing, and catch more
   problems than before.
** When problems are found while syncing, suggest a database check instead of
   always (and sometimes inappropriately) forcing a full sync.
** Fix an issue where a problem syncing media was incorrectly reported as a
   problem with regular syncing, leading to unnecessary full syncs.
** When Anki detects a problem syncing media, it is now able to recover on the
   next sync.
** Media syncing no longer needs to send all files on the first sync, so if
   you have a lot of media you can import it via iTunes and media syncing will
   not need to transfer it again.
** Fixed an issue with leaking resources that could cause long media downloads
   to fail.
** Play a sound on sync completion, like in Anki 1.
** Syncing finishes faster in the no changes case, and should perform
   a bit better in other cases too.
** Fix an issue where a full sync wasn't being forced when it should have been.

* Integrated database check function, so it's no longer necessary to use
  the computer version to fix some errors.
* Faster startup and resume, especially when the user has lots of decks.
* Anki will no longer time out on startup when the user has hundreds or
  thousands of decks (though it's still recommended to reduce them to a more
  manageable number).

* Audio changes:
** Anki will now play audio even if the mute switch is on, as this was a
  common source of confusion in the past.
** By default, if music is playing in the background, its volume will be
  lowered while Anki is active so that any audio on the cards can be heard
  easily. You can use the Settings>Review>Quieten Music option to change this
  behaviour.
** Fixed a bug where tapping on a replay audio button could show the answer or
  advance to the next card.
** Fixed a bug where a replay audio button that appeared under your finger
  when showing the answer or next card could trigger audio to play.
** Make sure audio is properly configured when switching back to Anki.

* Importing changes:
** Faster importing.
** Fixed a bug where importing decks with modified note types could result
   in duplicates being imported.
** If the default deck options are set to random order, randomize cards
   when importing a shared deck.
** Fixed a resource leak in importing.

* Scratchpad improvements
** The scratchpad is now hidden and shown via actions, so you can bind it to
  taps, quickbar buttons and so on, or access it via Tools>All Actions.
** The on/off state of the scratchpad is now remembered per card type, rather
  than per deck.

* Tap handling improvements:
** Taps are now honored even in the left and right margins where the gesture
   zones exist - previously it was not possible to tap on links that fell in
   those areas.
** Fixed various issues where a tap could trigger links in the resulting card
   transition.
** Fixed tapping on "Show Hint" being interpreted as a tap to reveal answer.

* The custom study cram and tag study options have been merged into a single
  option that allows you to choose tags and card type, like the latest
  computer version of Anki.
* Bring LaTeX handling in line with the latest computer version of Anki.
* Fix an issue where the wrong number of answer buttons would appear in some
  circumstances.
* Add "mature correct" statistics to the graphs.
* Fix an issue where users couldn't sync in iOS7.
* When adding cards, default to the note type for current deck.
* Show filtered decks in blue in the deck list.
* Confirm deletion of non-filtered decks.
* When exiting the filtered deck options, only remove an empty filtered deck
  if it was just created.
* Fixed an issue that could cause crashes or DB corruption under rare
  circumstances.
* Improved database performance.
* Fixed a bug that could cause a background backup to get stuck.
* Fixed an issue with searching in field text.
* Don't save note if no changes have been made.
* Make sure to display furigana correctly when it has non-breaking spaces in it.
* Various minor fixes to stats
* The "Tap to hide nav bar" option now controls behaviour of both hiding and
  showing.
* Fixed an issue where the bottom of an answer could be hidden by the bottom
  bar, especially when "bigger answer buttons" was turned on.
* Fix some issues with pinching to expand/shrink images.
* Fix handling of the interval multiplier option for cards in the learn queue.
* Fix card:n search
* Confirm note delete in edit window
* Fix some option changes not taking affect until app restarted.
* Enable autocorrect and capitalization when adding/editing notes.
* Work around obscure iOS6 bug that was causing toolbar buttons on the deck
  list to disappear
* Fixed an issue where the counts of subdecks was not being tallied correctly
  in some cases, which could lead to syncs failing.
* Add Rebuild & Empty actions for filtered decks, which can be bound to taps,
  swipes, etc.
* If no camera available, show image library.
* Hide default deck if empty.
* Make sure we don't hide the marked star when rotating the screen.

= Changes in 2.0.3 =

2.0.3 was approved by Apple on Feb 7 2013, and is available in the app store.

 * A number of improvements to pinching to zoom:
 ** Pinching now updates the size as you pinch, instead of only when you've
    finished pinching.
 ** The size increase is more gradual now.
 ** Fixed a bug where only the first image would have its size changed.
 * Fixed a bug that could cause a partially-completed sync or import to be
   saved if the app was killed by the user.
 * When comparing typed-in answer in cloze field, make sure to properly strip
   optional hint.
 * The scratchpad is now slightly larger, with an option in the review
   settings to increase its size further.
 * Another fix for taps on links or audio buttons being accidentally
   interpreted as a tap to advance.
 * When review card repeatedly failed in relearning, make sure interval
   doesn't decrease below the minimum interval the user has set.
 * Ignore formatting tags in {{#Field}} replacements.
 * When adding, show note types in alphabetical order.
 * Fix bug where the list of the tags in the browser would disappear when
   collection uploaded from AnkiMobile. If you were affected by this,
   Tools>Maintenance>Check DB in the desktop should bring the list of tags
   back.
 * Fix answer ticks appearing in wrong place when device rotated on deck list
   screen.
 * When using a filtered deck with rescheduling disabled, on the last step
   show "(end)" instead of nothing.
 * Strip leading/trailing whitespace in tags, which fixes {{#Tags}} and also
   slight misalignment when included on cards.
 * Don't crash when user tries to set zero backups.
 * Don't crash when trying to add cards from within a filtered deck.
 * Fixed a bug where no counts were underlined when you switched from a
   finished deck to a non-finished one.
 * Fix "Replay" action when user has replay buttons disabled.
 * Fixed a bug where media deleted on the desktop was not deleted on
   AnkiMobile on the next sync.
 * Fixed a bug where a random order custom study deck created on AnkiMobile
   could not be edited with the desktop.
 * Fix tap zones moving up/down when the navigation bar is hidden/shown with a
   tap.
 * Fixed a bug that was causing the app to crash when visiting the upgrade
   screen on some iOS versions.
 * If the collection somehow gets into an unreadable state, it is now backed
   up to iTunes and a new one put in its place.
 * Fixed a crash on some iOS versions when a sync failed.
 * Make sure we show the replay button even if user has disabled autoplay.
 * Fix play button on sound files with non-latin text.
 * Fixed a bug where the finished message would not display when the daily
   review limit had been exceeded.
 * Fixed issue with image resizing where landscape images were being cropped.
 * Fix an issue where audio occasionally wouldn't autoplay when going through
   cards quickly.
 * Other minor fixes.

= Changes in 2.0.2 =

2.0.2 was approved by Jan 25 2013, and is now in the app store.

 * AnkiMobile now takes automatic backups of your collection once an hour. If
   you accidentally make a mistake, you can restore a backup via iTunes.
 * Audio replay buttons are now displayed on your card for each audio file you
   have attached, like previous AnkiMobile versions did.
 * Custom study now has a limit to tags option that allows you to select tags
   to include and exclude like the desktop version, instead of having to type
   them in.
 * AnkiMobile now has a native scratchpad, which can be enabled from
   Settings>Review. If you were previously using the scratchpad add-on, you
   can remove the old scratchpad from your cards by going to Edit>Cards in the
   desktop version of Anki and deleting all the scratchpad-related text.
 * When a link on a card is tapped, it's now opened in an external Safari window
   instead of within Anki, so that children can't use Anki to circumvent
   content restrictions. You can double tap the home button and click on Anki
   to quickly return to study.
 * If you upgraded from Anki 1, you should have an "Upgrading" option in the
   settings screen. If you go into that and choose to remove that option, it
   will clean up any old .anki decks and media you had in the old version,
   freeing up space.
 * Automatically replay audio after it's recorded.
 * When creating a filtered deck, it defaults to searching in the current deck
   now.
 * Tapping on links on cards will no longer accidentally trigger a tap as
   well.
 * Tapping to advance to the answer or next card will no longer accidentally
   trigger a link as well.
 * AnkiMobile now shrinks images to a more usable size when added from the
   camera.
 * Notify when a leech is encountered.
 * Add confirmation to note delete.
 * Fixed a bug where syncing would fail after a shared deck was added to your
   collection.
 * Fixed a bug where syncing would fail after a previous sync was interrupted
   by network trouble.
 * If a bug in syncing is encountered, the next sync will now ask you which
   side you wish to keep in order to fix the problem.
 * Up to date with the desktop 2.0.5 version. Among other things:
   ** Review dates now have a random factor applied like previous versions so
     they spread out more.
   ** Fails in relearning apply the failure multiplier each time.
   ** Fix issues with clozes and <% %> in templates.
 * Fix a crash when the user had two identical deck names with different
   unicode encoding. 
 * Possible fix for issues syncing over a proxy server that requires
   authentication.
 * When notes are buried, they should be removed from learning to avoid errors.
 * If you cancel out of a filtered deck creation, it will no longer stick around.
 * Fix an issue where the sync screen sometimes didn't disappear when the network
   connection was flaky.
 * Fix crash when searching for decks with a wildcard.
 * Fix issue where AnkiMobile could run out of memory when importing a large
   collection from iTunes.
 * Don't allow custom study on a filtered deck, as it's not valid.
 * Fix alignment issues with the type in the answer feature.
 * Fix issues where tags could be blanked out when editing if you saved before
   they appeared on screen.
 * Fix importing of LaTeX images from shared decks.
 * Fix crash when renaming deck to child of itself.
 * Fix some issues where the graphs were inconsistent with the desktop
   version.
 * Fix the next/previous buttons sometimes not scrolling when editing.

 * When showing the question, scroll back up to top.
 * Fix some cloze issues.
 * The "preview" custom study option should not reschedule cards.
 * Include exact counts in card types graph.
 * Remove unused "preset" button from iPad filter/cram screen.
 * Allow "tap to show navigation bar" on the finished screen.
 * Add missing "correct"  text to today stats.
 * Fix issues with answer bar being overlapped.
 * Fixed display of some LaTeX.
 * Fixed an issue where particular non-latin text could cause a card not to display.

= Changes in 2.0.1 =

2.0.1 was approved by Apple on Nov 13 2012.

 * Added "Custom Study" feature from the latest desktop version, which makes
   it easier to extend the daily new card or review limits, and create
   filtered decks. Due to time constraints the "limit by tag" option has not
   been implemented yet; it is expected to come in the next release.
 * Filtered decks can still be created manually; the screen is now accessed
   via Tools>More (or can be bound to a tap, swipe, etc).
 * Added Today section to statistics, like on latest desktop.
 * Fixed various issues with audio handling:
 ** Audio now stops when transitioning to different screen.
 ** AM now honours the "autoplay audio" setting of the desktop.
 ** AM now honours the "replay question when answer shown" setting of the desktop.
 ** Fixed bug where multiple audio fields didn't play correctly when card shown.
 ** Fixed bug where multiple audio clips could play at the same time.
 ** Fixed bug where question audio was replayed when answer was shown.
 ** Don't hide replay button if audio in question but not answer.
 * Import/export improvements:
 ** You no longer need to choose between adding to or replacing the collection
    when importing via iTunes or adding a shared deck.
 ** Shared deck importing is much faster, and no longer can cause AnkiMobile
    to run out of memory.
 ** Shared deck importing now copes more gracefully with cards that were
    originally based on the same note type, and duplicate media names.
 ** Fixed an issue where an iTunes export wasn't included media even if
    "include media" was selected.
 * Fixed an issue where media added on the device via the camera/photo
   library/recording facility was not being uploaded to AnkiWeb during a sync,
   which caused a "media sanity check failed" message. If you continue to get
   such messages, please export your collection with media via iTunes (as
   described in the manual), and import it into the desktop program. After
   doing that and syncing, the problem should go away.

   tools screen.

   media.
 * Don't crash if the user tries to add an empty deck name.
 * Fix cards being shown twice when returning from edit mode.
 * Fix reviews being reset to a 1 day interval even if the user had provided a
   non-zero lapse %.

= Please Read Before Upgrading to 2.0 =

AnkiMobile 2 is a big update, and depending on the features you used
previously and how comfortable you are with computers, it may take a little
while to set up and get used to.

As the old AnkiWeb was shut down on Feb 7 2013, the old version will no longer
be able to sync, but you can continue to use iTunes to transfer decks to and
from a computer.

As Apple do not provide the ability to download previous versions from the app
store, you may also want to <<backup,create a backup of the old version>> before
upgrading.

[[v2]]
= What's New in 2.0 =

AnkiMobile 2.0 is based on Anki 2.0, a new version for computers that has been
in development for over a year and a half. It's faster, has much-improved
synchronization, and introduces some useful new features.

It's highly recommended that you check out the
http://ankisrs.net/docs/changes.html[desktop changes page]. The top section
lists the most important changes, and many of the changes also apply to
AnkiMobile.

As for mobile-specific changes compared to the previous release:

 * AnkiMobile has been rewritten from scratch to avoid all the problems that
   were caused by the old toolkit. Combined with the improvements in Anki 2,
   almost every action is noticeably faster, and the app is more stable.
 * Syncing of sounds and images has been greatly simplified due to Anki 2.0's
   integrated media syncing: no more messing around with Dropbox or being
   unable to sync media added on your device back to the desktop.
 * Shared decks can now be added directly from your mobile device, without
   requiring access to a computer.
 * You can now add privately shared decks as well, either from a private
   website, a mail attachment, or any other app that supports the "Open in..."
   protocol.
 * AnkiMobile now provides the same graphs and statistics that Anki 2 does.
 * You can now customize the colours of the app, with more customizations
   likely to come in the future.
 * Support for the iPhone 5.
 * iOS4.2 support has been dropped, as Apple don't make it possible to support
   the iPhone 5's bigger screen and iOS4.2 at the same time.
 * Swiping has been considerably improved. Instead of requiring a long press
   before the swipe is recognized, swipes start from the left or right side of
   the screen. You no longer have to choose between text selection and swipes:
   both can be used at once.
 * Searching/browsing no longer limits you to 100 matches: it can display your
   entire deck at once, even if it's thousands of cards big.
 * Searching is much, much faster.
 * Searching supports the same searches as Anki 2, including queries such as
   "cards with tag 'Important'", "cards with interval over 3 years", "cards
   failed today", and so on. Please see the updated manual for more
   information.
 * iTunes import/export is a lot easier now. To move cards to your mobile
   device for example, you just file>export on the desktop, copy the resulting
   single file to iTunes, and import from AnkiMobile. Media is automatically
   packaged into the single file when you export, and filenames with foreign
   character are handled without issue. Exporting is even easier: export from
   AnkiMobile, drag the file from iTunes, and double click on it to open up
   the desktop client and replace your collection with the updated version.
   More information is available in the manual.
 * And more!

In the interests of not delaying the 2.0 release, the old Lookup action has
only been partially ported. While it's still possible to open a dictionary app
from a link on your card, it's not currently possible to open a dictionary
based on the currently selected text. There are also some usability issues
with the scratchpad at the moment, where short taps will be treated as a tap
action. This should be fixed in the next release.

Screenshots from the new version:

[[backup]]
= Backing Up AnkiMobile 1 =

To create a backup of the old version of AnkiMobile so that it's possible to
revert to it if you desire, please follow the following steps:

 . Connect your device via the USB cable.
 . Open iTunes if it's not already open.
 . Wait until your device finishes syncing, or sync manually if you have
   disabled automatic syncing.
 . In the top left "Library" section, click on "Apps".
 . Locate Anki in your list of apps, and right click on it. (Ctrl+click on a
   Mac)
 . Choose "Show in Finder" or similar, to open your file browser.
 . You should see a file like "AnkiMobile 1.8.ipa". Copy this file somewhere
   else in order to back it up.

If you accidentally upgraded before syncing, you may be able to recover the
old version from your trash or recycling bin, as iTunes automatically places
it there when you sync a new version.

To revert to the old version, drag the .ipa file onto iTunes. After confirming
that you want to replace the app with a previous version, sync your device
again to load the old version back onto it.

= The Upgrade Process =

The fastest and most reliable way to upgrade is to ensure your decks are
synced or copied to your computer prior to upgrading, and then to perform the
upgrade on the computer. This is documented in more detail in the
link:am-upgrade.html[upgrade documentation].

AnkiMobile also provides an online upgrade for use in emergencies. This
upgrade will bundle up your decks, send them to an internet server, and then
download the new versions. Because this can fail if you have an unreliable
internet connection or your decks have problems, it's recommended that you
upgrade via the desktop instead.
